Post my experience here to help future applied math and statistics applicants.
# My profile and results

Undergrad Institution: State, Known for math  
Major(s): Applied Math  
Minor(s): None  
GPA: 3.97 (around 20 upper division/graduate math or coding related courses)  
Type of Student: Asian, first gen  
  
GRE Revised General Test:  
Q: 170  ; )  
V: 149  : (  
W: 3.5   
Didn't sumbit to most schools with such a low verbal score. Wasted almost 1000 bucks.
  
GRE Subject Test in Mathematics:  None, cancelled last moment due to Covid related
  
  
Program Applying: Applied math Ph.D., Statistics Ph.D. 
  
Research Experience:One REU in deep learning/PDE, resulted in a paper.  

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: None?  

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Tutored in math learning center for 1 semester, TAed 2 semesters  

Any Miscellaneous Points that Might Help: 2 letters from research mentors(probably very very strong), third letter from different letter writers, but I expect all to be strong.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: self-taught CS knowledge, but no officially recorded on transcripts, I mentioned in personal statement and on resume, not sure if schools will consider this.

**Acceptance: Stony Brook(AMS), Colorado State(Statistics)**

**Rejections: Cornell(CAM)**

**Awaiting Decision: UIUC Stats, Virginia stats, Boston stats, Northwestern stats, Ohio stats, Pittsburg stats, Berkerley IEOR master, Columbia Data science master**

# My thoughts
1. Don't underestimate yourself. I didn't apply to many prestigious programs because I thought I didn't even have a chance to get in. But, for sure, I regret it as I have seen, on Math GRE forum, many successful results from aaplication who have similar backgrounds as me.
2. Think about what you really want to do in graduate studies first, and do some research on potential programs to see if there are faculty members whose research areas allign with yours.
3.  Go for masters if you are not ready. Academia is competitive nowadays, most applied math Ph.D. graduates(not from schools like MIT) work in the industry.
4. If your goal is to become a program developer, ML/DS researcher, algorithm developer, and etc. for big tech companies, and you think you have better chances of getting into applied math programs than CS programs, there are programs that allow interdisciplinary works in computer science, to name a few, Johns Hopkins and U of Maryland.
5. Generally, applied math is a little bit easier to get in than pure math programs for most schools.
6. Ask your letter writers if your rec. letters will be strong unless you know them well enough that you know the letters will be good. Generic letters don't help.
7. GRE DOESN'T matter that much for PhD programs, don't waste time and money on it.
8. Apply to 2-3 safety schools, but not too many. Apply to more reach schools if you can afford the money and time it takes, you never get it unless you apply.
