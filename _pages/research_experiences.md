Deep Learning and Active Learning for Solving PDEs(2021 Summer at Texas Tech)
======
* Participated in the NSF funded REU program “Mathematical, Statistical and Computational Methods for Problems inthe Life Sciences”.
* Designed Active Learning based Sampling to adaptively sample training examples to faster the convergence.
* Designed Self-normalized algorithm to simulate draws from unnormalized distributions.
* Built deep learning framework with Pytorch under Conda environment and trained models on both a remote GPU cluster from university lab and on Google Colab.
* Reproduced 3 recent DL based PDE solvers:  Deep Rits Method, Deep Galerkin Method, Weak Adversarial Networks
* [Paper here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13988)
* [Git Repo here](https://github.com/wenhangao21/Active-Learning-Based-Sampling-for-High-Dimensional-Nonlinear-Partial-Differential-Equations)
Mathematical Biology(2020 Fall)
======
* Research-based course on Mathematical Biology.
* Projects: Influenza Epidemics; Population Dynamics: Lotka-Volterra Model and Logistic Model
* Projects can be found here: [Analysis_of_Bacteria_Growth](https://wenhangao21.github.io/files/Analysis_of_Bacteria_Growth.pdf), [Lotka_Volterra_Model](https://wenhangao21.github.io/files/Lotka_Volterra_Model.pdf), [Influenza_Epidemics](https://wenhangao21.github.io/files/Influenza_Epidemics.pdf),
