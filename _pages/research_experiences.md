Deep Learning and Active Learning for Solving PDEs(2021 Summer)
======
* Participated in the NSF funded REU program “Mathematical, Statistical and Computational Methods for Problems in the Life Sciences”.
* Designed Active Learning based sampling technique to adaptively sample training examples for LSM-based deep PDE solvers to faster the convergence.
* Proposed a self-normalized sampling algorithm to simulate draws from an unnormalized probability distribution.
* Reproduced 3 recent(recent at that time) Deep Learning based PDE solvers: Deep Rits Method, Deep Galerkin Method, Weak Adversarial Networks

Mathematical Biology(2020 Fall)
======
* Research-based course on Mathematical Biology.
* Projects: Influenza Epidemics, Population Dynamics: Lotka-Volterra Model, Population Dynamics of Cicadas and Flies: Logistic Model
