I'm a Data Scientist at Kaggle. Before starting this job, I was getting my PhD in Linguistics fromÂ [the University of Washington](https://linguistics.washington.edu/). My personal research is on [computational sociolinguistics](https://makingnoiseandhearingthings.com/2017/06/13/what-is-computational-sociolinguistics-and-whos-doing-it/), or how our social identity affects the way we use language in computational contexts.

Here are some of the things I'm up to these days:
* I stream [livecoding on Twitch every Friday at 4:00 PM Pacific](https://www.twitch.tv/rctatman). Past live streams can be found [on the Kaggle Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqFaTIg4myu9f21aM1POYVeoaHbFf1hMc).
* I'm [one of the organizers of R-Ladies Seattle](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-seattle/).
* I moderate the LingStatsChat Slack channel, a place for friendly discussion & help on linguistic and statistical topics. If you're interested, you can join at [this link](https://lingstatschat-autoinvite.herokuapp.com/).
