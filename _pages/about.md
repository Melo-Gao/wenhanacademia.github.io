I'm an incoming Ph.D. student in Applied Mathematics at Stony Brook University.  

Previously, I obtained a Bachelor of Science degree from [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/) in both [applied mathematics](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/ams/)ðŸ“™ and [pure mathematics](http://www.math.stonybrook.edu/)ðŸ“•.

I'm interested in Machine Learning, discrete math, graph theory, and many other topics in applied mathematics and computer science. ðŸ‘€

Open for internship opportunities in Machine Learning(Deep Learning, Recommender Systems, etc.), software development, R&D, computer vision, and so on. Legally allowed to work in the U.S., not seeking sponsorship now or in the future.  
Proactive and fast learner. Great interpersonal skills and ability to work independently and as part of a team.  
Solid math skills in analysis, modeling, and discrete algorithms.  
Solid math foundation in Machine Learning and Deep Learning.  
Solid skills in Data Structures and Algorithms with extensive experience in Python.  
Extensive experience in writing computational mathematics programs/softwares.  
Experience with Matlab, C++, Java, Octave, JavaScript, and Visual Basic.  
Experience with PyTorch and Training on Remote GPU clusters.
Research Experience in applying deep learning to solve real world problems.
