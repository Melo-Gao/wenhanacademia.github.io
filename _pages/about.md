I'm a second year Ph.D. student in Applied Mathematics at Stony Brook University supervised by [Professor Yi Liu](https://jacoblau0513.github.io/). 

Previously, I obtained a Bachelor of Science degree from [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/) in both [applied mathematics](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/ams/)ðŸ“™ and [pure mathematics](http://www.math.stonybrook.edu/)ðŸ“•.

I'm interested in Neural Operators and AI for Science; I'm also broadly interested in Machine Learning, discrete math, graph theory, and many other topics in applied mathematics and computer science. ðŸ‘€
