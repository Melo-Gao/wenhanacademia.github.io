I'm a developer advocate for [Rasa](https://rasa.com/), where I'm helping devlopers build and deploy conversational AI applications using our open source framework. ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¬

I have a PhD in Linguistics fromÂ [the University of Washington](https://linguistics.washington.edu/). My research was on [computational sociolinguistics](https://makingnoiseandhearingthings.com/2017/06/13/what-is-computational-sociolinguistics-and-whos-doing-it/), or how our social identity affects the way we use language in computational contexts. Previously I was [a data scientist at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman) and I'm still a Grandmaster. 

Here are some of the things I'm up to these days:
* I stream livecoding most Wednesdays and Fridays at 9:00 AM Pacific. You can join me on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/rctatman). 
* I'm [one of the organizers of R-Ladies Seattle](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-seattle/).
* I moderate the LingStatsChat Slack channel, a place for friendly discussion & help on linguistic and statistical topics. If you're interested, you can join at [this link](https://lingstatschat-autoinvite.herokuapp.com/).
