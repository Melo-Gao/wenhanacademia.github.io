I'm a data scientist at Kaggle. Before that, I was getting my PhD in Linguistics from [the University of Washington](https://linguistics.washington.edu/). My personal research is on [computational sociolinguistics](https://makingnoiseandhearingthings.com/2017/06/13/what-is-computational-sociolinguistics-and-whos-doing-it/), or how our social identity affects the way we use language in computational contexts. I'm currently a Data Preparation Analyst at Kaggle, where I'm working to increase the breadth & depth of the data available on their [public data platform](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and developing [educational material](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/list-of-5-day-challenges).

I moderate the LingStatsChat Slack channel, a place for friendly discussion & help on linguistic and statistical topics. If you're interested, you can join at [this link](https://lingstatschat-autoinvite.herokuapp.com/).
