When I'm not working, I have a number of hobbies. I enjoy gaming: both video games and strategic boardgames. I also knit, crochet and spin. My Ravelry id is rctatman and I've even been known to release the occasional knitting pattern. And I love to bake.

I also enjoy circus arts. The picture of me to the left was taken at Versatile Arts, an aerial studio in Seattle, by the fabulous Sabina Boehm. You can see the dance trapeze performance it's from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b1qfrdynfqxyuyr/rachael_TrapeezePiece.MTS?dl=0).
