*   I was featured in the January edition of Seattle Met's "[Quote Unquote](https://www.seattlemet.com/articles/2017/12/19/meet-rachael-tatman-professional-emoji-whisperer)", talking about emoji and linguistics. The interview also featured this emoji-tastic photo by [Joshua Huston](https://www.seattlemet.com/producers/joshua-huston).
*   I was interviewed about sociolinguistic bias in automatic speech recognition for [this article](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2141940-donate-your-voice-so-siri-doesnt-just-work-for-white-men/) by New Scientist and [this story](http://kuow.org/post/turns-out-siri-might-be-racist) by KUOW.
*   My research on dialect and gender bias in Youtube's automatic captions was covered in depth by the [Daily Dot](http://www.dailydot.com/debug/google-voice-recognition-gender-bias/), [San Francisco Chronicle](http://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Voice-assistants-stumble-over-regional-accents-10890340.php) and [L'Atelier (in French)](http://www.atelier.net/trends/articles/assistants-virtuels-doivent-travailler-reconnaissance-vocale_444906).
