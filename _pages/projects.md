# Research Experience

## Deep Learning and Active Learning for Solving PDEs(2021 Summer at Texas Tech)
======
* NSF funded summer research program.
* Designed Active Learning based Sampling to adaptively sample training examples to faster the convergence.
* Designed Self-normalized algorithm to simulate draws from unnormalized distributions.
* Built deep learning framework with Pytorch under Conda environment and trained models on both a remote GPU cluster from university labs and on Google Colab.
* Reproduced 3 recent DL based PDE solvers:  Deep Rits Method, Deep Galerkin Method, Weak Adversarial Networks
* [Paper here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13988)
* [Git Repo here](https://github.com/wenhangao21/Active-Learning-Based-Sampling-for-High-Dimensional-Nonlinear-Partial-Differential-Equations)

## Projects

Projecting the Effectiveness of Covid Vaccines
======
* A program written in Visual Basic that takes user input and outputs corresponding predictive data, including constant model and probabilistic model, of Covid-19 disease population dynamics and its visualization in plot and graphs.
* [Details here](https://github.com/wenhangao21/Active-Learning-Based-Sampling-for-High-Dimensional-Nonlinear-Partial-Differential-Equations)

Computational Mathematical Biology: Population Dynamics
======
* Projects written in Matlab to model population dynamics with numerical algorithms.
* [Analysis of Bacteria Growth](https://wenhangao21.github.io/files/Analysis_of_Bacteria_Growth.pdf)
